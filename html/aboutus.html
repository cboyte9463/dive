  Hamilton Eats (About us!!)
</h1>
<h3 style="font-family:Trebuchet MS; text-align:center; color:#0564b2;"> back story </h3>
<p style="font-family:Trebuchet MS; text-align:center; color:#0564b2;">
  Hamilton Eats was founded by Chris Adams and Frank Smith. Chris and Frank met each other in high school, when they both joined the culinary cooking team. They were very
  competitive with each other at first, but after knowing each other for a couple months, they started working together to create amaxing different flavours. They started
  by cooking for culinary fairs at other Hamilton schools, and swept the competiton. The lead director of the culinary organzation of Hamilton insisted that they were too
good for the Hamilton cooking fairs. Chris, Frank, and their small team of chefs started entering cooking competitions across Ontario. The food and flavours they created were
so different and daring, and still had a taste of comfort. The judges were all amazed by the amount of skill in the small culinary team. They offered them a free entry into
the world famous "Fresh eats!" cooking competition. The culinary crew traveled to Brazil and tried to impress the judges with their different tastes and flavours, but the
judges were more interested in a guatemalan culinary crew. The small Hamilton culinary crew ended up coming second, which really brought some of the team down. Chris came
up with the idea that they should start a restaurant business back in their home town. They all used their money they made from all the competitions and bought a small building
on locke street. Chris and Frank renovated the building and created the menu together. They ordered all the supplies they thought they would nee to make enough food food for about a week.
Frank hired friends from their culinary team to help cook, and Chris's girlfriend and her friends were the waitresses. On opening day they were so busy they ran out food
supplies after 3 hours. There were articles in the news paper and in magazines about the amazing restaurant on locke street that had no name. Chris and Frank forgot to name
their restaurant. So many different names went through their head and they couldn't decide on what to name it. After a huge fight, they got a phone call from a tv company
that they wanted to feature their restaurant on a show called "Hamilton Eats". Chris and Frank looked at each other at the same time, and new exactly what to do. The next
day Frank and Chris were painting on their door, "Welcome to Hamilton Eats".

<p style="font-family:Trebuchet MS; text-align:center; color:#0564b2;">
After Hamilton Eats opened 12 years ago, they opened 4 other locations and have employed over 100 people. They have changed some of their menu to make it less crazy
and more people will try familiar foods but with different flavours. Frank and Chris are both co-managing all 5 restaurants across Hamilton, but they still try to cook
at their orignal location at locke street as much as possible. Their restaurant was featured on food network's "You gotta eat here!" and "Diners, Drive-ins,and Dives".
It was also feautured on cable 14's "Hamilton Eats" and chch news. Frank and Chris were also acknolaged by famous chef Gordon Ramsey saying how amazing and creative their
food is.
